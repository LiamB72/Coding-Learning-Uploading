#this exercise is out of my reach of understanding

#this program is bad, thus dont blame me i've tried atleast
#To the reason of it being bad it's because it's asking :
#"Create a linear fonction and its variation table in python" while i'm only a 4 week python student like how ;-;

m = int(input("votre coef. directeur est : "))
p = int(input("votre ordonnée à l'origine est : "))
x = 10

f = m*x+p

#has to make a variation table but i don't know how
